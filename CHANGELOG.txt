Version 2.0
***********
2009/04/0
Rewrites & cleanups all over the place.
-- port to drupal6/ubercart2.
-- rewrote menu code.
-- rewrote code that used tapir to use the drupal table api.
-- rewrote the dashboard code (counters were incorrect, code was ugly)
-- new date&time handling code, fixes issues on some configurations.
-- removed old timezone handling code. Handling it the drupal way.
-- reworked the monthly_report admin_users functions. They were ugly & slow (N+1 queries problem)
-- you can now select multiple statuses for which to award commissions.
-- cancelling an order ( or changing from an "award" status) will now remove the commission.
-- removed the counts table, running live queries now. Less bug-prone.
-- added the "all orders" tab to the affiliate dashboard. Shows all orders by status created with the affiliate's id.
-- added a more detailed unique clicks view, displaying user ip, if the cookie was set, etc.
-- many bugfixes.
