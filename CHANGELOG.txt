CHANGELOG for uc_affiliate2 module

Version 2.1
***********
-- translation updates (some strings weren't translatable)
-- updated the commission removal routines, we don't try to remove commissions that aren't there anymore :)
-- simplified the admin_users form code ( for amounts paid to the affiliate). Thanks to freakalis for the tip
-- query fixes. Reimplemented the uc_affiliate2_clicks function. We are now compatible with PostgreSQL. Thanks to Chris (cjscullyca) for his fixes
-- fixes to the code we use to generate timestamps and get records from the db. Should be problem free now.
-- the affiliate url now uses user id's instead of names. Old urls still supported, of course. Thanks to lonehorseend.
-- use prices with VAT / taxes. Thanks to kenwen/longwave
-- add support for customizable affiliate URL schemes (by jjeff)
-- fix for "affiliate code generation user issue" (allow generating links for users other than the current one)

Version 2.0
***********
2009/05/06
Rewrites & cleanups all over the place.
-- port to drupal6/ubercart2.
-- rewrote menu code.
-- rewrote code that used tapir to use the drupal table api.
-- rewrote the dashboard code (counters were incorrect, code was ugly)
-- new date&time handling code, fixes issues on some configurations.
-- removed old timezone handling code. Handling it the drupal way.
-- reworked the monthly_report admin_users functions. They were ugly & slow (N+1 queries problem)
-- you can now select multiple statuses for which to award commissions.
-- cancelling an order ( or changing from an "award" status) will now remove the commission.
-- removed the counts table, running live queries now. Less bug-prone.
-- added the "all orders" tab to the affiliate dashboard. Shows all orders by status created with the affiliate's id.
-- added a more detailed unique clicks view, displaying user ip, if the cookie was set, etc.
-- many bugfixes and smaller changes.
