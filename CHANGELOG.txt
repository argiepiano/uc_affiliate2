***********
2009/03/05
-- fixed typo. Removed an unused function ( uc_affiliate2_get_domain)
-- code style cleanups all over the place.
-- invalid redirect url is now a drupal path.
-- don't validate the invalid redirect url if none has been provided (preventing the settings from being saved.)
-- rewrote the affiliate id processing function. Removed code duplication and killed a handful of bugs, known to cause blank screens and 404s.
-- Update role retrieval code to avoid future bugs. Reported by Scott.

Those that don't have drupal on a subdomain can enable the handling in settings.
